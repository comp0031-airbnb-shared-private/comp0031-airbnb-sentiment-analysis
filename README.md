## Personal Contribution

This project is part of a **group project** (repo private), with my personal contribution focused on the following:
- Implementing **sentiment analysis** using natural language processing model **VADER**.
- Forecasting future review and listing metrics using **Prophet**.
- Visualising and plotting results in `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` and towards the end of `prophet.ipynb`.  
- A detailed discussion of the results is available in the **research paper** upon request.
